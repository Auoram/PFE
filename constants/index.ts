    {title: 'Should my child get shots if she is sick?',
    label: "In general, it's advisable to postpone vaccinations if your child is currently sick, especially if they have a fever. Vaccinating a sick child could potentially worsen their illness or mask symptoms of serious adverse reactions. It's best to wait until your child has fully recovered before proceeding with vaccinations. However, if the illness is mild and not accompanied by a fever, your healthcare provider may recommend going ahead with vaccinations. Always consult with your child's healthcare provider for personalized advice based on their specific health condition."},
    {title: 'Are there any medical conditions that would make vaccination unsafe for my child?',
    label: "Yes, there are certain medical conditions in which vaccination should be avoided or postponed. These include severe allergic reactions to vaccine components, immunodeficiency disorders, and certain treatments that suppress the immune system. Additionally, if a child has experienced a severe reaction to a previous vaccine dose, further vaccination with the same vaccine may be contraindicated. It's important to discuss your child's medical history with their healthcare provider to determine if any contraindications to vaccination exist."},
    {title: 'How can I manage common side effects of vaccination at home?',
    label: "Most side effects of vaccination are mild and temporary, such as soreness at the injection site, low-grade fever, or mild fussiness. These can often be managed at home with simple remedies like rest, cool compresses, and over-the-counter pain relievers if recommended by your healthcare provider. It's important to monitor for signs of more serious reactions, such as high fever, persistent crying, or signs of allergic reaction, and seek medical attention if necessary.",},
    {title: 'Are there any alternative vaccine schedules I can follow for my child?',
    label: "While some parents may seek alternative vaccine schedules, it's essential to understand that deviating from the recommended vaccination schedule can leave children susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases for longer periods. The recommended vaccine schedule is carefully designed to provide the best protection at the earliest age possible. Altering this schedule may increase the risk of disease outbreaks and complications. It's crucial to discuss any concerns or preferences regarding vaccination schedules with your child's healthcare provider.",},
    {title: 'What should I do if my child misses a scheduled vaccine dose?',
    label: "If your child misses a scheduled vaccine dose, it's important to catch up as soon as possible to maintain protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. Depending on the vaccine and your child's age, your healthcare provider may recommend a catch-up schedule to ensure they receive all necessary doses. It's essential to communicate with your child's healthcare provider and follow their guidance to ensure your child remains up-to-date with their vaccinations.",},
